## General
# OUTPUT_DIR, character - output directory
# OUTPUT_SUFFIX, character - sample id
# FASTQ_INPUT, character - folder with input FASTQs or single input file. Accept compressed (.gz) or uncompressed.
# THREADS, numeric - number of thread available to split the process.
# N_CHUNKS, numeric - split the data into that many chunks before starting. Each chunk will be processed by 1 core.
# COMBINE_FILES. Combine files from multi-threading. Required for generating report.
# GENERATE_REPORT, boolean - Should a rmarkdown report be generated? Only work if COMBINE_FILE is TRUE.
# CLEANUP_BEFORE, boolean - should the intermediate files be cleaned afterwards ? 
# CLEANUP_AFTER, boolean - should you remove the initial folder?
# SILENT, boolean - remove part of the std output.

## chimeric_mapping_validation
# VALIDATE_CHIMERIC: boolean - run the chimeric detection
VALIDATE_CHIMERIC: TRUE

## extractBarcodes
# WHITELIST, character - Path to the barcode whitelist. If left "", will use the one stored in the package.
# SELECTED_BC, list ([1,2,...]) - selected barcodes. If left "", will look for all the barcodes available in the whitelist.
WHITELIST: ""

## filter_trim_demultiplex
# READ_TRIMMING, boolean - should the barcode / dT / TSO be trimmed? Will leave the poly-A tail and (CCCG).
# MIN_READS, numeric - minimal number of reads assigned to a barcode to report it. 
# UMI_TYPE: "NONE", "MONOMER" or "TRIMER"
# STRAND_SPECIFIC, boolean - if true, will reverse complement reads in 3'->5' based on their oligo-dT orientation.

# Minimap2
# MINIMAP2_Binaries, character - Full path or replace by "minimap2" if installed.
# MINIMAP2_BED, character - BED file generated with paftools.js
# MINIMAP2_REF, character - Pre-Indexed file .mmi only.
# MAX_MEMORY, numeric - Minimap2 requires ~10 Gb memory to run. Running it in parallel can quickly overload the system. Will take 75% of the RAM as reference by default to preserve ressources.
